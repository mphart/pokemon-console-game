version 1.01
    created project

version 1.02
    renamed terrain.h, terrain.c to map.h, map.c
    wrapped terrain (char array) in new map_t types
    created world_t type, including an array of map_t and an x and y coordinate
    map_t type now keeps track of all path entry points
    main can no longer access map.c 
    added input in main.c
    added moving between maps
    added flying to arbitrary maps
    made pokemart generation rarer

version 1.03
    rewrote a lot of the map generation code 
        -map_t now contains a double array of tile_t, which contain a TileType enum
        -biome seeds are placed in 8 different sections at random, then grown using flood_fill as before
        -dijkstra's algorithm is used to place paths
        -gates are now connected based on other generated maps
        -no more segfault at world border
    created new character_t type
        -contains the map location and type of character_t
    created new costmap_t type
        -records the cost to get to every square from a given start square
    world_t now keeps track of the player
    for testing purposes world_t has a hiker and rival as well that are set at the player's location
