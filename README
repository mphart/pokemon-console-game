Author : Mason Hart (mphart)

Running this program : 'make run' in the terminal

Terrain Generation : The terrain is represented by a character array of size 80*21. 
When a terrain is generated, seeds are randomly placed around the map, with certain types being more common than others. 
Next, spots are randomly selected and if they are not blank they will fill the surrounding nonempty squares. 
Next, the border of rock is generated. Finally, the two paths and two buildings are then placed.
